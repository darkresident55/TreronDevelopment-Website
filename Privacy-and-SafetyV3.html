We do not endorse any third-party websites, services, or applications. If you have any questions or concerns regarding your data on third-party sites, please refer to their privacy policies.</p>

    <h2 id="retention">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than one (1) month past the start of the idle period of the user's account.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2 id="information-security">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

    <h2 id="minors">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to minors.</p>
    <p>Prior to utilizing this policy for any inappropriate purposes, please be informed that we abstain from the collection of minor user information. Typically, data is discarded when deemed unnecessary for purposes other than usernames, items, and user regions. We routinely dispose of location data and IP logins to ensure safety each time a user logs out, thus preventing doxing and the collection of minor data.</p>

    <h2 id="privacy-rights">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
    <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
    <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
    <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>
    <p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.</p>
    <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below or updating your preferences.</p>
    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

    <h2 id="do-not-track">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p><strong>In Short:</strong> Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
